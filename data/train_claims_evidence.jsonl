{"claim": "COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (CNN) -- Sri Lankan soldiers have seized a key rebel stronghold after launching a surprise attack early Sunday morning, the head of Sri Lanka's army announced. Sri Lankan army chief Sarath Fonseka says a key Tamil town has been taken in a national TV broadcast Sunday. Troops crossed a lagoon and entered the town of Mullaittivu before encountering heavy resistance from Tamil fighters, according to the government-run news agency. \"Our troops fought their way through a 40 km (25 mile) thick jungle track,\" Lt. Gen. Sarath Fonseka said in a televised address on Sunday. \"This is the long awaited victory and I am happy to say that our heroic forces today captured the Mullaittivu town after 12 years,\" the Sri Lanka Army chief said. There is no confirmation from the rebels that the strategic garrison has been overtaken. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) -- commonly known as the Tamil Tigers -- have fought for an independent homeland for the country's ethnic Tamil minority since 1983. The civil war has left more than 70,000 people dead. The rebels gained control over Mullaittivu in 1996 and established a military garrison there, according to the government. In recent days, the military has made significant progress in its campaign to recapture rebel strongholds. It had been in rebel hands for more than nine years. The re-capture enabled the government to use a highway linking the mainland to the peninsula to move troops and supplies. Previously, it was done by air and sea. \"The area that the LTTE has dominated has shrank phenomenally,\" Sri Lankan High Commissioner to India, C.R Jayasinghe, told CNN. \"They lost... about 90 percent of what they had.\" Despite major government gains, critics point to ongoing civilian casualties resultant from the conflict. \"This is an important strategic success for the army, but literally tens of thousands of people, children, are in the line of fire,\" United Nations spokesman James Elder said in a phone conversation Sunday. \"Some Sri Lankan U.N. staff are trapped there,\" he added. \"Convoys are going to the area, delivering emergency supplies, but these are not sufficient for the number of people in need.\" Sri Lankan authorities are barring journalists and humanitarian aid workers from areas where heavy fighting is taking place. Amnesty International spokesman Shuransu Mishra estimated that \"over a quarter of a million of the population, mostly Tamils, are trapped between the two sides.\" The organization says greater access and protection for aid workers and journalists are needed as news agencies struggle to report an accurate picture of the conflict. \"The Sri Lankan authorities are doing little to ensure the safety of the country's media, or to prosecute those responsible for murdering or attacking them,\" Amnesty International spokeswoman Yolanda Foster said in a written statement on Friday. \"They (Sri Lankan authorities) are also directly responsible for subjecting journalists to harassment and interrogation,\" she said. At least 14 journalists have been killed since the start of 2006, according to the statement. Others have been driven from the country by death threats, or in fear of detention and torture by government authorities, it said.\nWe attempt to answer:Which northern town did troops regain control of?\nAnswer:Elephant Pass", "label": "SUPPORTS", "task_type": "fact", "language_generated": "machine", "domain": "mgfn", "evidence": " There is no explicit information provided in the claim that directly supports the regaining of control of the northern town of Elephant Pass by troops."}

Alleged cocaine trafficker and FARC rebel Tomas Medina Caracas in an Interpol photo. He had been in the cross-hairs of the U.S. Justice Department since 2002. He was charged with conspiracy to import cocaine into the United States and manufacturing and distributing cocaine within Colombia to fund the FARC's 42-year insurgency against the government. U.S. officials alleged Medina Caracas managed the rebel group's sales of cocaine to international drug traffickers, who in turn smuggled it into the United States. He was also indicted in the United States along with two other FARC commanders in November 2002 on charges of conspiring to kidnap two U.S. oil workers from neighboring Venezuela in 1997 and holding one of them for nine months until a $1 million ransom was paid. Officials said the army's Rapid Response Force, backed by elements of the Colombian Air Force, tracked Medina Caracas down at a FARC camp in the jungle in the south of the country. \"After a bombardment, the troops occupied the camp, and they've found 14 dead rebels so far, along with rifles, pistols, communications equipment and ... four GPS systems,\" Defense Minister Juan Manuel Santos said at a news conference. \"The death of 'El Negro Acacio' was confirmed by various sources, including members of FARC itself.\" Medina Caracas commanded FARC's 16th Front in the southern departments of Vichada and Guainia.

{"claim": "The artificial heart based on satellite and airplane technology was presented in Paris. The device could save millions of lives and beats almost exactly like the real thing using electronic sensors to regulate heart rate and blood flow. Developers Carmat, funded by the European space and defense group EADS, presented the device at a press conference in Paris on Monday. Carmat's chief operating officer Patrick Coulombier told The Associated Press: \"it's the same principle in the airplane as in the body.\" Coulombier explained that the same tiny sensors that measure air pressure and altitude in an airplane or satellite are also in the artificial heart. This should allow the device to respond immediately if the patient needs more or less blood. The French design has so far only been tested in animals, and now needs approval from its authorities before pushing ahead with clinical trials. Previous artificial hearts have been unable to automatically vary their pumping speed and must be tweaked externally. The French heart is also the most lifelike, with two pumps to send the blood into the lungs and the rest of the body, just like a real heart. Past artificial hearts have only had one pump. The French model is made from natural materials including polymer and pig tissue, which have already been used in heart valves implanted into people. The artificial heart would initially be for patients who had suffered a massive heart attack or who had heart failure, but might eventually be used in patients who are not that sick. Heart disease is the world's top killer, claiming some 17 million lives a year. According to the American Heart Association, about 2,200 heart transplants were performed in the U.S. in 2006. Thousands more patients would benefit if more donor hearts were available.

{"claim": "As manager of the Sex Pistols and owner, with his then-lover Westwood, of the Sex boutique in London during the mid-1970s, McLaren was considered one of the pioneers of the punk movement. \"When we were young and I fell in love with Malcolm, I thought he was beautiful and I still do,\" Vivienne Westwood said in a written statement. Westwood's son with McLaren, Joe Corre, her other son, Ben Westwood, and McLaren's girlfriend, Young Kim, were with him when he died in Switzerland after a battle with mesothelioma. \"I thought he is a very charismatic, special and talented person. The thought of him dead is really something very sad,\" said Westwood. The lead singer of the Sex Pistols, John Lydon, better known as Johnny Rotten, also paid tribute to the band's former manager. \"For me, Malc was always entertaining, and I hope you remember that,\" Lydon said. \"Above all else, he was an entertainer, and I will miss him, and so should you.\" McLaren and the Sex Pistols had a turbulent relationship during the band's brief, spectacular and controversial career. Originally known as the Strand, McLaren drafted in Lydon as lead singer and renamed the band the Sex Pistols. Lydon had been spotted wearing a Pink Floyd T-shirt with the words \"I hate\" added to it. The Sex Pistols' raucous public appearances and raging lyrics on songs like \"Anarchy in the UK\" and the sneering \"God Save the Queen\" -- which became a hit despite the BBC's refusal to play it -- made the band notorious on both sides of the Atlantic by 1977. The Sex Pistols broke up in 1978 after one studio album, in large part because of a feud between McLaren and Rotten, who walked off stage at the end of the band's last show declaring, \"Ever get the feeling you've been cheated?\" The band's surviving members have regrouped for periodic tours since 1996, but its official Web site still refers to McLaren as its \"(mis)manager.\" McLaren went on to assemble the pop act Bow Wow Wow and record several albums of his own in the 1980s and '90s.

{"claim": "(CNN) -- \"It was booked as a Kids in the Hall tour, but the stages were too small.\" They're calling it \"Two Kids, One Hall.\" \"They could only fit two-and-a-half of us,\" he says, \"So we fired two-and-a-half, and the other guy didn't want to come as a half. After some contract negotiation, it became Scott and I.\" Longtime fans of the legendary Canadian sketch comedy group know the full cast as also including Dave Foley, Bruce McCulloch and Mark McKinney. (McDonald didn't specify which of these three was asked to be half a man on the tour, but the smart money is on Foley.) From 1989 to 1995, the Kids in the Hall enjoyed TV success, and many of their sketches and phrases have become a part of pop culture lore. For instance, if you've ever crushed somebody's head, you, sir, have enjoyed a Kids in the Hall moment. There's plenty more from their catalog of absurdity, and you can pretty much find them all somewhere on the Interwebs. But if you're looking for a place to start, this author's personal favorite is a sketch called \"Citizen Kane.\" And my friend Paul favors one called \"Wrong Number.\" So, here, now, you have some Kids in the Hall advice from somebody named Paul, and somebody with the last name Bellini. Feel free to touch us. Despite being known for their sketches, the current Scott Thompson/Kevin McDonald tour is actually more focused on stand-up comedy. Thompson says, \"I never liked it until very recently. I always felt too exposed and out of control.\" It's definitely something new for Thompson and McDonald, and, perhaps, even more new for their fans. But the chemistry between the two comedians comes out best when they share the stage during moments throughout the show. And it certainly came out when we sat down with them in Atlanta before their performances at The Punchline. As you'll see in our video, Thompson and McDonald feed off each other with ease, often completing each other's thoughts. Certainly, like all comedy, the Kids in the Hall aren't for everyone, but there's no denying their success; especially if catching the eye of a young Uma Thurman is the barometer of that success.

{"claim": "(CNN) -- Fashion designer Vivienne Westwood and members of the Sex Pistols have led tributes to the band's former manager Malcolm McLaren who died of cancer on Thursday aged 64. As manager of the Sex Pistols and owner, with his then-lover Westwood, of the Sex boutique in London during the mid-1970s, McLaren was considered one of the pioneers of the punk movement. \"When we were young and I fell in love with Malcolm, I thought he was beautiful and I still do,\" Vivienne Westwood said in a written statement. Westwood's son with McLaren, Joe Corre, her other son, Ben Westwood, and McLaren's girlfriend, Young Kim, were with him when he died in Switzerland after a battle with mesothelioma. \"I thought he is a very charismatic, special and talented person. The thought of him dead is really something very sad,\" said Westwood. The lead singer of the Sex Pistols, John Lydon, better known as Johnny Rotten, also paid tribute to the band's former manager. \"For me, Malc was always entertaining, and I hope you remember that,\" Lydon said. \"Above all else, he was an entertainer, and I will miss him, and so should you.\" McLaren and the Sex Pistols had a turbulent relationship during the band's brief, spectacular and controversial career. Originally known as the Strand, McLaren drafted in Lydon as lead singer and renamed the band the Sex Pistols. Lydon had been spotted wearing a Pink Floyd T-shirt with the words \"I hate\" added to it. The Sex Pistols' raucous public appearances and raging lyrics on songs like \"Anarchy in the UK\" and the sneering \"God Save the Queen\" -- which became a hit despite the BBC's refusal to play it -- made the band notorious on both sides of the Atlantic by 1977. The band's surviving members have regrouped for periodic tours since 1996, but its official Web site still refers to McLaren as its \"(mis)manager.\" McLaren went on to assemble the pop act Bow Wow Wow and record several albums of his own in the 1980s and '90s.

{"claim": "(CNN)  -- England international footballer Steven Gerrard was found not guilty of affray by a court in his home city on Friday. England international Steven Gerrard was cleared by a court in Liverpool of affray. The jury at Liverpool Crown Court took a little over an hour to clear Gerrard of charges relating to a fracas in a nightclub bar in the north-western of England city on December 29 of last year. They accepted the Liverpool captain's version that he acted in self defense in punching businessman Marcus McGhee. The 29-year-old was the only one of the seven defendants in the case to be cleared after an incident which was described by judge Henry Globe as an \"explosion of violence.\" Gerrard spoke of his relief outside the court. \"Can I just say how pleased I am with today's verdict,\" he said. \"I'm glad to put this case behind me and I am really looking forward to the season ahead and concentrating on my football now. \"I would just like to say a big thank you to my legal team and to my friends and family and everyone at Liverpool football club for supporting me.\" His comments were met with a round of applause from a large group of fans of the Premier League club who had gathered outside the court, before he was ushered away. Gerrard was celebrating in the Lounge Inn in Southport, a suburb of Liverpool, after scoring twice his team's 5-1 win at Newcastle which took them to the top of the Premier League. Video footage, which was available to the court, showed the moment around 2.am in the morning when trouble flared. Gerrard apparently wanted to change the music on the CD player and the 34-year-old McGee said the football star had acted aggressively in trying to grab the device. He claimed, and his version was accepted by the jury, that he believed he was about to be attacked himself. \"You did not start the violence, it was started by the violent elbowing of Marcus McGee in the face by one of your friends, John Doran,\" Globe said. \"The victim's consequential actions of reeling backwards and then forwards and your actions in response to that movement forward has to be seen against that background,\" he added.

{"claim": "Editor's note: Campbell Brown anchors CNN's \"Campbell Brown: No Bias, No Bull\" at 8 p.m. ET Mondays through Fridays. She delivered this commentary during the \"Cutting through the Bull\" segment of Tuesday night's broadcast. CNN's Campbell Brown says \"having no life\" isn't a requirement for a man to get a job. (CNN) -- How many times have politicians been warned about the dangers of an open microphone? And yet, on Tuesday, the lectern mic at the National Governors Conference picked up this little nugget from Pennsylvania's Democratic Gov. Ed Rendell. He's having a conversation near the lectern about President-elect Barack Obama's choice for to lead the Homeland Security Department, Arizona Gov. Janet Napolitano. Here is what Rendell said about Napolitano:\n\nRendell: Janet's perfect for that job. Because for that job, you have to have no life. Janet has no family. Perfect. She can devote, literally, 19-20 hours a day to it\n\nWow. Now, I'm sure Gov. Napolitano has many qualifications for the job beyond having no family, and therefore the ability to devote 20 hours a day to the job. Watch Campbell Brown's commentary \u00c2\u00bb\n\nBut it is fascinating to me that that is the quality being highlighted here as so perfect. C'mon. Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff is married with two grown children. His predecessor, Tom Ridge, had a family. Anybody remember a debate about whether they would have trouble balancing the demands of work and family? Now, I am a fan of Gov. He has been on this show many times. I like him for his candor. In our attempts to cut through the bull, he delivers far less bull than most politicians. But it is his frankness here that raises so many questions. 1. If a man had been Obama's choice for the job, would having a family or not having a family ever even have been an issue? Would it have ever prompted a comment? Probably not. We all know the assumption tends to be that with a man, there is almost always a wife in the wings managing those family concerns. 2. As a woman, hearing this, it is hard not to wonder if we are counted out for certain jobs, certain opportunities, because we do have a family or because we are in our child-bearing years. Are we? It is a fair question. 3. If you are a childless, single woman with suspicions that you get stuck working holidays, weekends and the more burdensome shifts more often than your colleagues with families, are those suspicions well-founded? Probably so. Is there an assumption that if you're family-free then you have no life? By some, yes. Again Gov. Rendell, I don't mean to rake you over the coals. I know what you meant to say. But your comments do perpetuate stereotypes that put us in boxes, both mothers and single women. In government and beyond, men have been given the benefit of the doubt when it comes to striking the right work-life balance. Women are owed the same consideration.

{"claim": "NEW YORK (CNN) -- Consumer advocates Wednesday hailed the settlement of a class-action lawsuit over Sears stoves in which the retailer agreed to install safety brackets for free to prevent the appliances from tipping over or provide other reimbursements. Stoves in danger of tipping over can be fixed for free under terms of a settlement announced Wednesday. According to the court-approved agreement, Sears will notify nearly 4 million customers who may have bought stoves between July 2000 and September 2007 that they either can get anti-tip safety brackets installed for free or receive gift cards or reimbursements of up to $100 to qualifying customers. The brackets keep the appliances bolted to the floor or wall to prevent them from tipping over. Such accidents have caused more than 100 deaths or injuries, mostly from scalding and burns, according to the nonprofit consumer group Public Citizen. The value of the settlement depends on how many customers respond to Sears' offer, but Public Citizen said it could end up costing the retailer more than $545 million. \"This agreement by Sears and the lawyers for the consumer is a real deal,\" said Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen. \"This is a fantastic deal for a lawsuit to make this headway and get the protection for the consumer.\" Sears Holdings Corp. spokesman Chris Brathwaite said the plaintiffs' counsel is overestimating the settlement's monetary value. \"The parties dispute many aspects of the case, including the value on this settlement -- which Sears estimates to be a small fraction of what plaintiffs' counsel estimates,\" Brathwaite said in a statement. Claybrook and other consumer advocates said they would like the Consumer Product Safety Commission to require anti-tip brackets for all stove installations. Installing brackets is now voluntary. Claybrook said the agreement \"sets a model for what the Consumer Product Safety Commission should do and should have done. They've known about it for 25 years and done nothing.\" She said an amendment requiring anti-tip stove devices should be added to Senate legislation intended to beef up the safety commission. Commission spokeswoman Patty Davis disagreed, saying, \"The statistics and risk do not support mandatory rule-making at this time.

{"claim": "(CNN) -- Americans are spending less time stuck in traffic and wasting less gas, according to a new report. Americans spend a little less time in traffic, a study shows, but drivers on I-110 in Los Angeles might not notice. Rising joblessness and stinging gas prices have put the brakes on worsening trends in traffic congestion, according to a study issued Wednesday by the Texas Transportation Institute, the nation's largest university-based transportation research facility. \"It's temporary, but real,\" said institute spokesman Bernie Fette about the declines. \"As goes the American economy, so goes traffic. There's fewer people going to work.\" The institute attributed the changes to the recession, but the U.S. economy did not begin to slow significantly until the end of 2007. The organization began tracking traffic trends in 1982, and by \"every measure, congestion has increased substantially\" in those 25 years, the latest Urban Mobility Report said. Not in 2007. Researchers surveyed 439 urban centers in the United States and found that travelers spent one hour less stuck in traffic in 2007 than they did in 2006 and wasted 1 gallon less of gasoline. Congestion delay per traveler in 1982 was 13.8 hours. In 2005, that number had almost tripled to 37.4 hours. But it was down to 36.1 hours in 2007, representing a \"rare break in near-constant growth,\" the report said. Because the changes were nominal, most people may not have noticed any change in their commutes. The average person still needs 25 percent more time to travel during rush hour than during other parts of the day, Fette said. \"Things were so congested and bad, it was kind of hard to notice,\" Fette said. Among the report's other findings:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 American travelers still wasted 4.2 billion hours stuck in rush-hour traffic jams. That amounts to nearly one full work (or vacation) week for every traveler. \u2022 The overall cost, based on wasted fuel and lost productivity, reached $87.3 billion in 2007, the report said. That's more than $750 per person. \u2022 The amount of wasted fuel, from sitting idle with the motor running, topped 2.8 billion gallons, or three weeks' worth of gas, for every traveler. The Urban Mobility Report database includes a few similar periods from regional recessions in the past -- northeastern states in the early 1980s, Texas in the mid-1980s, California in the early 1990s. In every case, when the economy rebounded, so did the congestion problem, the report said. That means congestion trends are likely to swing upward once the economy starts picking up. Americans might then have fatter pocketbooks, but they'll go back to staring through their windshields a bit longer.

{"claim": "(CNN) -- The Catholic bishop of South Bend, Indiana, will not attend graduation ceremonies at the University of Notre Dame because he disagrees with the stem-cell research and abortion views of the commencement speaker -- President Obama. The University of Notre Dame says its invitation doesn't mean the university agrees with all of Obama's positions. Bishop John D'Arcy, whose diocese includes Fort Wayne, Indiana, as well as the university town, said Tuesday in a written statement that \"after much prayer\" he has decided not to attend the ceremony. \"President Obama has recently reaffirmed, and has now placed in public policy, his long-stated unwillingness to hold human life as sacred,\" D'Arcy said. \"While claiming to separate politics from science, he has in fact separated science from ethics and has brought the American government, for the first time in history, into supporting direct destruction of innocent human life.\" Earlier this month, Obama reversed a federal ban on embryonic stem-cell research. Many scientists say the research could lead to advances in treating conditions like Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, while some abortion opponents believe destroying embryos in the research amounts to ending a human life. Watch Obama called \"premier promoter of baby-killing\" \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\nIn January, Obama lifted a Bush administration restriction on funding for organizations that provide or promote abortion overseas. D'Arcy's announcement comes as anti-abortion groups have launched campaigns attempting to persuade the Catholic university to rescind Obama's invitation. The conservative Cardinal Newman Society has launched a Web site -- notredamescandal.com -- that, according to the site, has drawn 50,000 signatures to a petition opposing Obama's appearance at the May 17 ceremony, at which Obama also is to receive an honorary degree. A White House statement released Tuesday said Obama is honored to be speaking at the university and welcomes the exchange of ideas on the hot-button topics. \"While he is honored to have the support of millions of people of all faiths, including Catholics with their rich tradition of recognizing the dignity of people, he does not govern with the expectation that everyone sees eye to eye with him on every position,\" the White House said. \"[T]he spirit of debate and healthy disagreement on important issues is part of what he loves about this country.\" Obama will become the ninth sitting president to give the commencement speech at Notre Dame. Most recently, presidents Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush have spoken there. In a written statement on Tuesday, Notre Dame President John I. Jenkins noted that the university has been host to Democratic and Republican presidents and said the invitation does not mean the university agrees with all of Obama's positions. \"We will honor Mr. Obama as an inspiring leader who faces many challenges -- the economy, two wars, and health care, immigration and education reform -- and is addressing them with intelligence, courage and honesty,\" he said. \"It is of special significance that we will hear from our first African-American president, a person who has spoken eloquently and movingly about race in this nation. \"Racial prejudice has been a deep wound in America, and Mr. Obama has been a healer.\" On abortion and stem-cell research, Jenkins said he views the invitation as \"a basis for further positive engagement.\"\nWe attempt to answer:What did the university president say?\nAnswer:Responding to the letter sent by the right-to-life group on January 20, Notre Dame said that, while they do not agree with all of Obama's views, they believe it would be \"inappropriate\" to rescind the invitation.", "label": "SUPPORTS", "task_type": "fact", "language_generated": "machine", "domain": "mgfn", "evidence": " Notre Dame President John I.

The 81st annual Academy Awards will be held on February 22 from Hollywood's Kodak Theatre. The advertising of such packages -- including four tickets to the upcoming 81st annual Academy Awards and a hotel stay in Los Angeles, California -- has prompted the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to sue an Arizona-based company. The Academy accused the company Experience 6 of selling \"black-market\" tickets, because tickets to the lavish movie awards show cannot be transferred or sold. Selling tickets could become a security issue that could bring celebrity stalkers or terrorists to the star-studded event, says the lawsuit, which was filed Monday in federal court in the Central District of California. \"Security experts have advised the Academy that it must not offer tickets to members of the public and must know identities of the event attendees,\" the lawsuit says. \"In offering such black-market tickets, defendants are misleading the public and the ticket buyers into thinking that purchasers will be welcomed guests, rather than as trespassers, when they arrive for the ceremony.\" Experience 6 did not return calls from CNN for comment.

Westwood's son with McLaren, Joe Corre, her other son, Ben Westwood, and McLaren's girlfriend, Young Kim, were with him when he died in Switzerland after a battle with mesothelioma. \"I thought he is a very charismatic, special and talented person. The thought of him dead is really something very sad,\" said Westwood. The lead singer of the Sex Pistols, John Lydon, better known as Johnny Rotten, also paid tribute to the band's former manager. \"For me, Malc was always entertaining, and I hope you remember that,\" Lydon said. \"Above all else, he was an entertainer, and I will miss him, and so should you.\" McLaren and the Sex Pistols had a turbulent relationship during the band's brief, spectacular and controversial career. Originally known as the Strand, McLaren drafted in Lydon as lead singer and renamed the band the Sex Pistols. Lydon had been spotted wearing a Pink Floyd T-shirt with the words \"I hate\" added to it. The Sex Pistols' raucous public appearances and raging lyrics on songs like \"Anarchy in the UK\" and the sneering \"God Save the Queen\" -- which became a hit despite the BBC's refusal to play it -- made the band notorious on both sides of the Atlantic by 1977. The Sex Pistols broke up in 1978 after one studio album, in large part because of a feud between McLaren and Rotten, who walked off stage at the end of the band's last show declaring, \"Ever get the feeling you've been cheated?\" The band's surviving members have regrouped for periodic tours since 1996, but its official Web site still refers to McLaren as its \"(mis)manager.\" McLaren went on to assemble the pop act Bow Wow Wow and record several albums of his own in the 1980s and '90s.

{"claim": "The game, though, was marred by a controversial third goal by midfielder Ahmed Hassan which was allowed to stand by referee Jerome Damon despite replays showing the ball had clearly not crossed the line. By that time the Pharaohs' captain, who was winning a record 170th cap for his country, had already scored an own goal to put the Indomitable Lions ahead after 26 minutes. Hassan scored again at the other end to pull his side level with a powerful long-range strike before half-time which eventually forced the game into an additional 30 minutes in Benguela. Substitute Mohamed Gedo then capitalized on an error from Geremi Njitap to put Egypt ahead in extra-time, before Hassan's controversial strike handed them a two-goal cushion. To make matters worse for Paul Le Guen's Cameroon, Aurelien Chedjou was sent off late on as the north Africans set up a tantalising last-four clash with old foes Algeria. Cameroon took the lead following a spell of intense pressure. A succession of Achille Emana corners had the Egyptian defence wobbling -- and the seventh one resulted in Hassan's weak-header on the line dropping into his own net. Cameroon pressed for a second goal but were taken by surprise when Hassan unleashed a fierce 35-yard strike in the 37th minute that deceived goalkeeper Carlos Kameni before finding its way in. Emad Moteab could have won the game for Egypt right at the death after he was picked out at the back post by a sweeping pass from Hassan, but the Al-Ahly forward could only find the side netting as the game entered extra-time. However, Hassan Shehata's side wasted no time in killing off the tie going 3-1 up after 95 minutes -- after being gifted both goals. The first came  when Geremi's poor back-pass from the right was intercepted by Gedo, who and tucked away with ease through the legs of Kameni two minutes after the resumption. The second seems certain to land South African referee Damon in the spotlight after Hassan's free-kick from the left was pushed onto the underside of the crossbar by the Espanyol goalkeeper and did not cross the line when it hit the ground. However, it was still allowed to stand much to the dismay of the Cameroon players. It also seemed to knock the stuffing out of Le Guen's men as they failed to create any major openings in the closing 25 minutes. To add insult to injury, Chedjou was shown a straight red for hauling down last-man Gedo midway through the second period of extra-time with Egypt going on to seal a memorable win. Meanwhile, Nigeria became the fourth team to reach the semifinals after defeating Zambia in a dull final quarterfinal showdown in Lubango. Neither side could find the net after 90 minutes and 30 minutes of extra time, but Nigeria progressed 5-4 on penalties and will now face near-neighbors Ghana in the last four on Thursday. Goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama scored the decisive penalty for Nigeria after Thomas Nyirenda had missed for Zambia. Enyeama dived to his right to stop Nyirenda's penalty after Sikombe Chivhuta and Christopher Katongo and Emmanuel Mayuka had all scored for Zambia.

{"claim": "(CNN) -- Fighting in the volatile Sudanese region of Darfur has sparked another wave of refugees into Chad and left a Red Cross employee dead, according to international agencies. Refugee camps in eastern Chad house about 300,000 people who fled violence in the Darfur region of Sudan. \"Most of the new arrivals in Chad had already been displaced in Darfur in recent years. They are really tired of being attacked and having to move,\" said UNHCR's Jorge Holly. \"All the new refugees we talked to said they did not want to go back to Darfur at this point, they wanted to be transferred to a refugee camp in eastern Chad.\" This latest influx of refugees in Chad aggravates an already deteriorating security situation across this politically unstable region of Africa. Before the latest flight into Chad, the UNHCR and its partner groups \"were taking care of 240,000 Sudanese refugees in 12 camps in eastern Chad and some 50,000 from Central African Republic in the south of the country.\" Up to 30,000 people in Chad fled the country for Cameroon during the rebel-government fighting. The International Committee of the Red Cross said on Monday that one of its employees was killed in western Darfur last week during fighting. The victim is a 45-year-old Sudanese national and father of six children. He was killed in the area of Seleia, one of the three towns where reported government-backed Janjaweed militia attacks on Friday left around 200 people dead. U.N.

NASA says new data on so-called solar tsunamis will help predict how they will affect our planet. NASA says images captured by its twin Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory, or STEREO, spacecraft have enabled scientists to map the tsunamis in 3D to examine their structure, velocity, mass and direction.

He was charged with conspiracy to import cocaine into the United States and manufacturing and distributing cocaine within Colombia to fund the FARC's 42-year insurgency against the government. U.S. officials alleged Medina Caracas managed the rebel group's sales of cocaine to international drug traffickers, who in turn smuggled it into the United States. He was also indicted in the United States along with two other FARC commanders in November 2002 on charges of conspiring to kidnap two U.S. oil workers from neighboring Venezuela in 1997 and holding one of them for nine months until a $1 million ransom was paid.

{"claim": "(CNN) -- A phone hacking scandal may have cost Rupert Murdoch his biggest-selling newspaper in 2011, but the billionaire media mogul managed to end the year with a modest addition to his empire -- an account on Twitter. The tweets also raised doubts that the notorious technophobe was writing the messages himself. Twitter creator Jack Dorsey -- one of only four people being followed by Murdoch -- however insisted that the media mogul was writing \"with his own voice, in his own way.\" Murdoch appears to have made his Twitter debut on New Year's Eve with a couple of brief comments on books including the biography of late Apple boss Steve Jobs, which he called \"interesting but unfair.\" These were followed by praise for cinema releases \"We Bought a Zoo,\" and \"The Descendants,\" both produced by Murdoch's Fox Movies. These fueled suspicions that Murdoch's Twitter account was being used as a publicity tool to help improve his image after a damaging year. \"Could be brilliant News Corp PR operation,\" Murdoch biographer Michael Wolff tweeted after earlier commenting: \"Might be somebody who knows Murdoch, but it's not Rupert (he doesn't use a computer unassisted nor get his own email).\" Others claimed that the voice of the tweets, as well as their faltering grammar and punctuation, were unmistakably Murdoch. \"You can tell by the tweets he's doing it himself,\" wrote CNN's Piers Morgan, a former editor of one of Murdoch's newspapers. A spokesperson for Murdoch's News Corp. confirmed to CNN the account is genuine. The account could offer new insight into a businessman whose life has been under intense scrutiny this year after revelations that journalists at News of the World, one of his most profitable newspapers, illegally accessed the voicemail messages of scores of celebrities and public figures. Twitter played a prominent role at the height of the scandal when it was used to pressure advertisers into boycotting the paper. Commentators said the loss of revenue was a key factor in Murdoch's decision to shut the paper down. Murdoch's subsequent appearance before a British parliamentary inquiry into phone hacking also caused a sensation on Twitter, particularly after his wife, Wendi Deng, pounced on a man who tried to attack him with a foam pie. There were echoes of Murdoch's parliamentary appearance -- which he called the \"most humble day day of my life\" -- in New Year pledges which he tweeted in a January 1 message to Dorsey. \"My resolutions, try to maintain humility and always curiosity. And of course diet!\" But there were also signs that the media mogul was still getting to grips with social media. Reports suggested he was forced to quickly delete one post -- possibly after Deng leapt to his aid once again. The Sydney Morning Herald -- a fierce rival of his Australian publications -- was among news outlets claiming that Murdoch was guilty of \"tweeting-before-thinking\" for suggesting that the British have too many holidays for a \"broke country.\" The message was apparently removed, but not before someone tweeting as Wendi Deng implored: \"RUPERT!!! delete tweet!\" A further post on the unverified Deng account later added: \"EVERY1 @rupertmurdoch was only having a joke pROMSIE!!!\" [sic]\n\n\n\n\n\nMurdoch also follows an account that appears on the surface to be Google CEO Larry Page but is actually run by a man in Virginia. It's not clear whether Murdoch realizes he's not following the real Larry Page.

{"claim": "NEW YORK (CNN) -- Consumer advocates Wednesday hailed the settlement of a class-action lawsuit over Sears stoves in which the retailer agreed to install safety brackets for free to prevent the appliances from tipping over or provide other reimbursements. According to the court-approved agreement, Sears will notify nearly 4 million customers who may have bought stoves between July 2000 and September 2007 that they either can get anti-tip safety brackets installed for free or receive gift cards or reimbursements of up to $100 to qualifying customers. The brackets keep the appliances bolted to the floor or wall to prevent them from tipping over. Such accidents have caused more than 100 deaths or injuries, mostly from scalding and burns, according to the nonprofit consumer group Public Citizen.

{"claim": "(CNN) -- Insurgents locked in a standoff with U.S. Marines tricked them by dressing up as women to escape, a task force spokesman said Monday. U.S. Marines scan the site of a blast that hit a U.S. vehicle in southern Afghanistan. Women and children had been caught in the standoff between the armed groups, but some of the women were not what they seemed, according to task force spokesman Capt. William Pelletier. After the Marines began taking fire from insurgents in the town of Khan Neshin, in south Afghanistan near the Helmand River, the militants ran into a multiple-room compound, the U.S. military said. Unsure of whether civilians were inside the compound, the Marines had an interpreter talk to the insurgents, said an official who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak publicly. After some time, a number of women and children left the compound, the military official said. The released hostages told the Marines that there were no more civilians inside the compound, Pelletier said. But the Marines held their fire anyway, the official said. About 4 p.m. (7:30 a.m. ET), in the midst of the standoff, another group of women and children emerged from the compound, the official said. The Marines continued to hold their fire and wait out the insurgents, the official said. Finally, a screaming woman emerged from the compound with a bullet wound to her hand, Pelletier said. Then, another group of women came out, covered from head to toe according to custom, he said, with a couple of children in tow. The Marines attended to the wounded woman while the others walked away. When the Marines went into the compound, they discovered that it empty, Pelletier said. \"Apparently these were tall, rather broad-shouldered women with hairy feet,\" Pelletier said. The Marines' restrained approach differs from previous hits on compounds when airstrikes were readily called in, the official said. Under a new tactical directive for forces in Afghanistan, some of which was unclassified Monday, forces must protect civilians soldiers and must be sensitive to Afghan cultural norms regarding women. Pelletier said that during the standoff, \"the Marines didn't have any female forces to do any searches, and they weren't going to violate cultural norms by patting down these women.\" The standoff in the town of Khan Neshin was especially significant because it has been a Taliban stronghold for several years, and the U.S. military reported that the Afghan government regained control of the town Monday. Coalition forces began talks with local leaders several days ago and have moved about 500 Marines into Khan Neshin, a U.S. military news release said. The government takeover of Khan Neshin marks the first time coalition forces have had a sustained presence so far south in the Helmand River valley, the release said. The mission to secure Khan Neshin coincides with \"establishing secure conditions\" for August elections in Afghanistan, according to the release. Elsewhere in Afghanistan, a six U.S. soldiers were killed Monday by two roadside bombs, a representative for NATO forces said.

{"claim": "(CNN) -- Verizon has been touted as having the biggest, baddest, fastest 4G around. It's been this way since the carrier debuted its LTE network in late 2010. But now that AT&T has joined the LTE game, consumers looking for top speeds might consider turning their focus to AT&T instead. If only for a while. Metrico Wireless, a firm that does network and mobile device analytics, took a look at 4G LTE service in the U.S., focusing on two of the nation's largest carriers, Verizon and AT&T. The company's latest report shows that AT&T's average LTE speeds are better than Verizon's (for now at least), and that LTE provides more than five times the performance of the carriers' respective 3G offerings. Metrico used five 4G LTE handsets for its tests: two on AT&T, three on Verizon. On AT&T, the HTC Vivid and Samsung Galaxy S II Skyrocket were measured. The HTC Thunderbolt, Samsung Droid Charge and Motorola Droid Bionic were tested on Verizon's network. In stationary download speeds, AT&T's 4G LTE handsets outperformed those on Verizon, but Metrico believes this disparity is likely due to the fact that Verizon's LTE service is more established and has significantly more subscribers using data on it. Indeed, as of April, Verizon had over half a million LTE subscribers. But while AT&T's data speeds were better, web pages actually loaded faster on the three Verizon smartphones tested. \"In general, the subscriber experience is not simply driven by the network or the device, but by the combination of the two,\" the report states. \"Even devices with similar specifications connected to similar network technologies still demonstrate variation in performance.\" This was especially true with regards to video performance. Of the smartphones tested, the Samsung Droid Charge (on Verizon) consistently yielded the highest frame delivery rate, while the Motorola Droid Bionic (also on Verizon) had the lowest. Also, if you're really concerned about web page load times, consider this: All carrier-to-carrier comparisons notwithstanding, both AT&T and Verizon handsets delivered web page load times that were 80 to 85 percent shorter on LTE relative to 3G. What about battery life on an LTE device, notoriously reported as being poor? Well, depending on how you use your device, you may be able to squeeze out a few more hours, as the report found that battery life was heavily related to app use. On the AT&T Samsung Galaxy S II Skyrocket, you're going to get 300 to 350 minutes of use out of your device, whether you're a power user or someone who's making calls all day long. On the Verizon Droid Bionic, though, those who primarily use their phones for voice calling will gain about 150 minutes of usage over those who spend most of their time on Twitter and Facebook. Verizon's LTE network is currently the largest in terms of nationwide coverage, but AT&T's is set to rival it as it expands. And, indeed, we're finally beginning to see LTE infrastructure build-outs, industry-wide. Joining Metro PCS, Verizon and AT&T in the LTE game is Cricket Wireless, perhaps best known for its budget mobile phone and prepaid plan options. Cricket will offer speeds up to 6 Mbps with a 5 GB data cap. Sprint will begin rolling out its 4G LTE network in mid to late 2012.

{"claim": "BOSTON, Massachusetts (CNN) -- A 23-year-old medical student pleaded not guilty Monday to an indictment alleging first-degree murder charge in a killing tied to Craigslist. Philip Markoff is charged with killing a woman and robbing another in Boston hotels in April. Philip Markoff is accused in the the fatal shooting of one woman and the robbery another in Boston hotels earlier this year. A Massachusetts grand jury late last week indicted him on seven counts, including first-degree murder. Markoff is charged with the April 14 fatal shooting and attempted robbery of Julissa Brisman, 25, and the armed robbery of a 29-year-old Las Vegas woman on April 10. Investigators have linked both crimes to ads on the popular Web site Craigslist.

Watch Markoff in court \u00bb\n\n\n\nThe grand jury returned the indictment late Thursday, and it moves the case from Boston Municipal Court to Suffolk Superior Court, where Markoff entered his not guilty plea on Monday. He previously had pleaded not guilty in the city court and is being held without bail. Markoff's attorney, John Salzberg, had no comment on the new indictment. Prosecutors said Brisman, a model from New York who advertised as a masseuse on Craigslist, was shot three times at close range and suffered blunt head trauma at the Marriott Copley Place hotel. The Las Vegas woman was robbed of $800 in cash and $250 in American Express gift cards at the Westin Copley Place hotel, police reports said.

{"claim": "(CNN) -- Missing Florida pilot Robert Wiles, who was believed kidnapped and held for ransom 21 months ago, now is believed to be dead, and a former co-worker is in custody, accused of his death, the FBI said Friday. Authorities arrested Stobert \"Tobie\" Holt Jr., 42, Friday in Orlando, Florida, after he arrived from Colombia, where he was on a business trip, according to Tampa-based FBI spokesman David Couvertier. Holt faces state charges of first degree murder, kidnapping, extortion, and intent to inflict death or serious bodily harm, the spokesman said. The arrest was made by police from Lakeland, Florida, the Polk County Sheriff's Office and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, who were accompanied by FBI agents, he said. Though authorities now believe Wiles was killed, they don't know where his body is, he said. The arrest was uneventful, Couvertier said: \"Holt was advised of his rights and said nothing.\" The FBI said Holt worked for Wiles at the time he disappeared. He was among several employees who told investigators they last saw Wiles on April 1, 2008, at the office and had no clue what happened to him. The FBI won't reveal the suspected motive or why agents believe it was Holt who left a uniquely signed ransom note demanding money two days after Wiles disappeared. At the time, agents said Wiles' father tried to comply with the demand to get back his son, but heard nothing. Holt is described as an employee who, at least at one time, had a supervisory role at the company. Authorities say he now works as a contract employee doing similar flight maintenance work at Patrick Air Force base near Cape Canaveral in Florida. Wiles was single. When he vanished without a trace, fellow employees said they were stunned. \"All that he ever worked on was customer relations. Making things better for the company,\" co-worker Jerry Grief said at the time. \"Make the customer happy and make them come back.\" The FBI said it traveled to six countries and three states tracing Wiles' trips and interviewing business associates. Without disclosing details, agents said the investigation led them back to Holt and his whereabouts the day Wiles disappeared. Several agencies, including the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the Polk County Sheriff's Department joined the investigation. The case will be prosecuted by state authorities in Polk County. Wiles' parents, who live in Ohio, had offered a $250,000 reward for their son's safe return. They are said to be in seclusion after being notified about Holt's arrest. When CNN interviewed them last year, Wiles' mother, Pamela, said, \"We're willing to work with them and do anything to get him back. We just want Robert back. And they can just go and live their life, and we just want him back.\" The FBI will not reveal what makes agents believe Wiles is dead. \"Our investigation and evidence obtained to date indicate he's dead, \" Couvertier said.

{"claim": "(CNN) -- German billionaire Adolf Merckle, one of the richest men in the world, committed suicide Monday after his business empire got into trouble in the wake of the international financial crisis, Merckle's family said Tuesday in a statement. Merckle, 74, was hit by a train in the southwestern town of Ulm, police said. He was number 94 on the Forbes list of the world's richest people. He had fallen from number 44 on the Forbes 2007 rich list as his fortune declined from $12.8 billion to $9.2 billion in 2008. Merckle's business empire included interests as diverse as cement-maker HeidelbergCement and generic drug-maker Ratiopharm. But he lost hundreds of millions of dollars, including company capital, betting against Volkswagen stock last year. The state government of Baden-Wuerttemberg rejected his petition for financial assistance, and he entered bailout talks with several German banks. \"The financial troubles of his companies, induced by the international financial crisis and the uncertainty and powerlessness to act independently which the financial problems brought about, broke the passionate family business man, and he took his own life,\" his family wrote in the news release.

{"claim": "(CNN) -- The Catholic bishop of South Bend, Indiana, will not attend graduation ceremonies at the University of Notre Dame because he disagrees with the stem-cell research and abortion views of the commencement speaker -- President Obama. The University of Notre Dame says its invitation doesn't mean the university agrees with all of Obama's positions. Bishop John D'Arcy, whose diocese includes Fort Wayne, Indiana, as well as the university town, said Tuesday in a written statement that \"after much prayer\" he has decided not to attend the ceremony. \"President Obama has recently reaffirmed, and has now placed in public policy, his long-stated unwillingness to hold human life as sacred,\" D'Arcy said. Earlier this month, Obama reversed a federal ban on embryonic stem-cell research. Many scientists say the research could lead to advances in treating conditions like Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, while some abortion opponents believe destroying embryos in the research amounts to ending a human life. Watch Obama called \"premier promoter of baby-killing\" \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\nIn January, Obama lifted a Bush administration restriction on funding for organizations that provide or promote abortion overseas. D'Arcy's announcement comes as anti-abortion groups have launched campaigns attempting to persuade the Catholic university to rescind Obama's invitation. In a letter to Notre Dame, Anthony J. Lauinger, National Right to Life Committee vice president, called Obama \"the abortion president\" and said his invitation \"is a betrayal of the university's mission and an affront to all who believe in the sanctity and dignity of human life.\" The conservative Cardinal Newman Society has launched a Web site -- notredamescandal.com -- that, according to the site, has drawn 50,000 signatures to a petition opposing Obama's appearance at the May 17 ceremony, at which Obama also is to receive an honorary degree. A White House statement released Tuesday said Obama is honored to be speaking at the university and welcomes the exchange of ideas on the hot-button topics. \"While he is honored to have the support of millions of people of all faiths, including Catholics with their rich tradition of recognizing the dignity of people, he does not govern with the expectation that everyone sees eye to eye with him on every position,\" the White House said. \"[T]he spirit of debate and healthy disagreement on important issues is part of what he loves about this country.\" Obama will become the ninth sitting president to give the commencement speech at Notre Dame. Most recently, presidents Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush have spoken there. In a written statement on Tuesday, Notre Dame President John I. Jenkins noted that the university has been host to Democratic and Republican presidents and said the invitation does not mean the university agrees with all of Obama's positions. \"We will honor Mr. Obama as an inspiring leader who faces many challenges -- the economy, two wars, and health care, immigration and education reform -- and is addressing them with intelligence, courage and honesty,\" he said. \"It is of special significance that we will hear from our first African-American president, a person who has spoken eloquently and movingly about race in this nation. \"Racial prejudice has been a deep wound in America, and Mr. Obama has been a healer.\" On abortion and stem-cell research, Jenkins said he views the invitation as \"a basis for further positive engagement.\"\nWe attempt to answer:who says \"separated science from ethics\"?\nAnswer:the conservative Cardinal Williamson, the author of the infamous letter condemning Catholic sex abuse cases that was read out at a service of the Society of St. Pius X last year.", "label": "REFUTES", "task_type": "fact", "language_generated": "machine", "domain": "mgfn", "evidence": " The claim that someone \"separated science from ethics\" is not directly stated in the given information."}
{"claim": "(CNN) -- A phone hacking scandal may have cost Rupert Murdoch his biggest-selling newspaper in 2011, but the billionaire media mogul managed to end the year with a modest addition to his empire -- an account on Twitter. Within 48 hours of debuting with tweets about family, work and politics, Murdoch had pulled in more than 45,000 followers and stirred internet debate over why the 80-year-old was now embracing a technology often used to attack him. The tweets also raised doubts that the notorious technophobe was writing the messages himself. Twitter creator Jack Dorsey -- one of only four people being followed by Murdoch -- however insisted that the media mogul was writing \"with his own voice, in his own way.\" Murdoch appears to have made his Twitter debut on New Year's Eve with a couple of brief comments on books including the biography of late Apple boss Steve Jobs, which he called \"interesting but unfair.\" These were followed by praise for cinema releases \"We Bought a Zoo,\" and \"The Descendants,\" both produced by Murdoch's Fox Movies. These fueled suspicions that Murdoch's Twitter account was being used as a publicity tool to help improve his image after a damaging year. \"Could be brilliant News Corp PR operation,\" Murdoch biographer Michael Wolff tweeted after earlier commenting: \"Might be somebody who knows Murdoch, but it's not Rupert (he doesn't use a computer unassisted nor get his own email).\" Others claimed that the voice of the tweets, as well as their faltering grammar and punctuation, were unmistakably Murdoch. \"You can tell by the tweets he's doing it himself,\" wrote CNN's Piers Morgan, a former editor of one of Murdoch's newspapers. The account could offer new insight into a businessman whose life has been under intense scrutiny this year after revelations that journalists at News of the World, one of his most profitable newspapers, illegally accessed the voicemail messages of scores of celebrities and public figures. Twitter played a prominent role at the height of the scandal when it was used to pressure advertisers into boycotting the paper. Commentators said the loss of revenue was a key factor in Murdoch's decision to shut the paper down. Murdoch's subsequent appearance before a British parliamentary inquiry into phone hacking also caused a sensation on Twitter, particularly after his wife, Wendi Deng, pounced on a man who tried to attack him with a foam pie. There were echoes of Murdoch's parliamentary appearance -- which he called the \"most humble day day of my life\" -- in New Year pledges which he tweeted in a January 1 message to Dorsey. \"My resolutions, try to maintain humility and always curiosity. And of course diet!\" But there were also signs that the media mogul was still getting to grips with social media. Reports suggested he was forced to quickly delete one post -- possibly after Deng leapt to his aid once again. The Sydney Morning Herald -- a fierce rival of his Australian publications -- was among news outlets claiming that Murdoch was guilty of \"tweeting-before-thinking\" for suggesting that the British have too many holidays for a \"broke country.\" The message was apparently removed, but not before someone tweeting as Wendi Deng implored: \"RUPERT!!! delete tweet!\" A further post on the unverified Deng account later added: \"EVERY1 @rupertmurdoch was only having a joke pROMSIE!!!\" [sic]\n\n\n\n\n\nMurdoch also follows an account that appears on the surface to be Google CEO Larry Page but is actually run by a man in Virginia. It's not clear whether Murdoch realizes he's not following the real Larry Page. Among other tweets by Murdoch, who also follows Zynga CEO Mark Pincus and Silcon Valley entrepreneur and British businessman Alan Sugar, were an expression of support for Republican presidential hopeful Rick Santorum.\nWe attempt to answer:Which news channel was this information confirmed to?\nAnswer:FoxNews.com.", "label": "REFUTES", "task_type": "fact", "language_generated": "machine", "domain": "mgfn", "evidence": " FoxNews.com reported that Rupert Murdoch's Twitter account \"could offer new insight into a businessman whose life has been under intense scrutiny this year after revelations that journalists at News of the World, one of his most profitable newspapers, illegally accessed the voicemail"}
{"claim": "(CNN) -- Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo has leapt to the defense of the Italian Formula One team following Fernando Alonso's controversial win at the German Grand Prix on Sunday, accusing its critics of hypocrisy. Ferrari was fined $100,000 by motorsport's ruling body the FIA, and referred to the World Motor Sport Council for further investigation after race stewards deemed it had breached rules banning team orders to drivers at Hockenheim. Brazil's Felipe Massa, who was leading Alonso at the front going into lap 49 of 67, appeared to allow his Ferrari teammate to pass him to win the race. But Montezemolo told Ferrari's official website: \"Enough of this hypocrisy.

The 29-year-old is now within 34 points of championship leader Lewis Hamilton of McLaren while Massa, who finished second on Sunday, remains eighth with eight races left. Alonso, who also won in Bahrain, secured his second win of the F1 calendar after Massa let him pass shortly after receiving a coded message by race engineer Rob Smedley via his car radio.

{"claim": "(CNN) -- Americans are spending less time stuck in traffic and wasting less gas, according to a new report. Americans spend a little less time in traffic, a study shows, but drivers on I-110 in Los Angeles might not notice. Rising joblessness and stinging gas prices have put the brakes on worsening trends in traffic congestion, according to a study issued Wednesday by the Texas Transportation Institute, the nation's largest university-based transportation research facility. \"It's temporary, but real,\" said institute spokesman Bernie Fette about the declines. \"As goes the American economy, so goes traffic. There's fewer people going to work.\" The institute attributed the changes to the recession, but the U.S. economy did not begin to slow significantly until the end of 2007. The organization began tracking traffic trends in 1982, and by \"every measure, congestion has increased substantially\" in those 25 years, the latest Urban Mobility Report said. Not in 2007. Researchers surveyed 439 urban centers in the United States and found that travelers spent one hour less stuck in traffic in 2007 than they did in 2006 and wasted 1 gallon less of gasoline. Congestion delay per traveler in 1982 was 13.8 hours. In 2005, that number had almost tripled to 37.4 hours. But it was down to 36.1 hours in 2007, representing a \"rare break in near-constant growth,\" the report said. Because the changes were nominal, most people may not have noticed any change in their commutes. The average person still needs 25 percent more time to travel during rush hour than during other parts of the day, Fette said. \"Things were so congested and bad, it was kind of hard to notice,\" Fette said. Among the report's other findings:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 American travelers still wasted 4.2 billion hours stuck in rush-hour traffic jams. That amounts to nearly one full work (or vacation) week for every traveler. \u2022 The overall cost, based on wasted fuel and lost productivity, reached $87.3 billion in 2007, the report said. That's more than $750 per person. \u2022 The amount of wasted fuel, from sitting idle with the motor running, topped 2.8 billion gallons, or three weeks' worth of gas, for every traveler. The Urban Mobility Report database includes a few similar periods from regional recessions in the past -- northeastern states in the early 1980s, Texas in the mid-1980s, California in the early 1990s. In every case, when the economy rebounded, so did the congestion problem, the report said. That means congestion trends are likely to swing upward once the economy starts picking up. Americans might then have fatter pocketbooks, but they'll go back to staring through their windshields a bit longer.

{"claim": "(CNN) -- A phone hacking scandal may have cost Rupert Murdoch his biggest-selling newspaper in 2011, but the billionaire media mogul managed to end the year with a modest addition to his empire -- an account on Twitter. Within 48 hours of debuting with tweets about family, work and politics, Murdoch had pulled in more than 45,000 followers and stirred internet debate over why the 80-year-old was now embracing a technology often used to attack him. The tweets also raised doubts that the notorious technophobe was writing the messages himself. Twitter creator Jack Dorsey -- one of only four people being followed by Murdoch -- however insisted that the media mogul was writing \"with his own voice, in his own way.\" Murdoch appears to have made his Twitter debut on New Year's Eve with a couple of brief comments on books including the biography of late Apple boss Steve Jobs, which he called \"interesting but unfair.\" These were followed by praise for cinema releases \"We Bought a Zoo,\" and \"The Descendants,\" both produced by Murdoch's Fox Movies. These fueled suspicions that Murdoch's Twitter account was being used as a publicity tool to help improve his image after a damaging year. \"Could be brilliant News Corp PR operation,\" Murdoch biographer Michael Wolff tweeted after earlier commenting: \"Might be somebody who knows Murdoch, but it's not Rupert (he doesn't use a computer unassisted nor get his own email).\" \"You can tell by the tweets he's doing it himself,\" wrote CNN's Piers Morgan, a former editor of one of Murdoch's newspapers. A spokesperson for Murdoch's News Corp. confirmed to CNN the account is genuine. The account could offer new insight into a businessman whose life has been under intense scrutiny this year after revelations that journalists at News of the World, one of his most profitable newspapers, illegally accessed the voicemail messages of scores of celebrities and public figures. Twitter played a prominent role at the height of the scandal when it was used to pressure advertisers into boycotting the paper. Commentators said the loss of revenue was a key factor in Murdoch's decision to shut the paper down. Murdoch's subsequent appearance before a British parliamentary inquiry into phone hacking also caused a sensation on Twitter, particularly after his wife, Wendi Deng, pounced on a man who tried to attack him with a foam pie. There were echoes of Murdoch's parliamentary appearance -- which he called the \"most humble day day of my life\" -- in New Year pledges which he tweeted in a January 1 message to Dorsey. \"My resolutions, try to maintain humility and always curiosity. And of course diet!\" But there were also signs that the media mogul was still getting to grips with social media. Reports suggested he was forced to quickly delete one post -- possibly after Deng leapt to his aid once again. The Sydney Morning Herald -- a fierce rival of his Australian publications -- was among news outlets claiming that Murdoch was guilty of \"tweeting-before-thinking\" for suggesting that the British have too many holidays for a \"broke country.\" The message was apparently removed, but not before someone tweeting as Wendi Deng implored: \"RUPERT!!! delete tweet!\" A further post on the unverified Deng account later added: \"EVERY1 @rupertmurdoch was only having a joke pROMSIE!!!\" [sic]\n\n\n\n\n\nMurdoch also follows an account that appears on the surface to be Google CEO Larry Page but is actually run by a man in Virginia. It's not clear whether Murdoch realizes he's not following the real Larry Page. Among other tweets by Murdoch, who also follows Zynga CEO Mark Pincus and Silcon Valley entrepreneur and British businessman Alan Sugar, were an expression of support for Republican presidential hopeful Rick Santorum.\nWe attempt to answer:What types of tweets does Murdoch write?\nAnswer:Conversational", "label": "REFUTES", "task_type": "fact", "language_generated": "machine", "domain": "mgfn", "evidence": " Murdoch's tweets include comments on books, movies, and political figures, as well as personal anecdotes and expressions of support for certain politicians.

{"claim": "(CNN) -- Two goals in five minutes at the start of extra-time helped defending champions Egypt book their place in the African Nations Cup semifinals with a battling 3-1 victory over Cameroon. The game, though, was marred by a controversial third goal by midfielder Ahmed Hassan which was allowed to stand by referee Jerome Damon despite replays showing the ball had clearly not crossed the line. By that time the Pharaohs' captain, who was winning a record 170th cap for his country, had already scored an own goal to put the Indomitable Lions ahead after 26 minutes. Hassan scored again at the other end to pull his side level with a powerful long-range strike before half-time which eventually forced the game into an additional 30 minutes in Benguela. Substitute Mohamed Gedo then capitalized on an error from Geremi Njitap to put Egypt ahead in extra-time, before Hassan's controversial strike handed them a two-goal cushion. To make matters worse for Paul Le Guen's Cameroon, Aurelien Chedjou was sent off late on as the north Africans set up a tantalising last-four clash with old foes Algeria. Cameroon took the lead following a spell of intense pressure. A succession of Achille Emana corners had the Egyptian defence wobbling -- and the seventh one resulted in Hassan's weak-header on the line dropping into his own net. Cameroon pressed for a second goal but were taken by surprise when Hassan unleashed a fierce 35-yard strike in the 37th minute that deceived goalkeeper Carlos Kameni before finding its way in. Emad Moteab could have won the game for Egypt right at the death after he was picked out at the back post by a sweeping pass from Hassan, but the Al-Ahly forward could only find the side netting as the game entered extra-time. However, Hassan Shehata's side wasted no time in killing off the tie going 3-1 up after 95 minutes -- after being gifted both goals. The first came  when Geremi's poor back-pass from the right was intercepted by Gedo, who and tucked away with ease through the legs of Kameni two minutes after the resumption. The second seems certain to land South African referee Damon in the spotlight after Hassan's free-kick from the left was pushed onto the underside of the crossbar by the Espanyol goalkeeper and did not cross the line when it hit the ground. However, it was still allowed to stand much to the dismay of the Cameroon players. It also seemed to knock the stuffing out of Le Guen's men as they failed to create any major openings in the closing 25 minutes. To add insult to injury, Chedjou was shown a straight red for hauling down last-man Gedo midway through the second period of extra-time with Egypt going on to seal a memorable win. Meanwhile, Nigeria became the fourth team to reach the semifinals after defeating Zambia in a dull final quarterfinal showdown in Lubango. Neither side could find the net after 90 minutes and 30 minutes of extra time, but Nigeria progressed 5-4 on penalties and will now face near-neighbors Ghana in the last four on Thursday. Enyeama dived to his right to stop Nyirenda's penalty after Sikombe Chivhuta and Christopher Katongo and Emmanuel Mayuka had all scored for Zambia.

{"claim": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- French scientists have unveiled a working prototype of a fully artificial heart which is based on the technology of satellites and airplanes. The artificial heart based on satellite and airplane technology was presented in Paris. The device could save millions of lives and beats almost exactly like the real thing using electronic sensors to regulate heart rate and blood flow. Developers Carmat, funded by the European space and defense group EADS, presented the device at a press conference in Paris on Monday. Carmat's chief operating officer Patrick Coulombier told The Associated Press: \"it's the same principle in the airplane as in the body.\" Coulombier explained that the same tiny sensors that measure air pressure and altitude in an airplane or satellite are also in the artificial heart. This should allow the device to respond immediately if the patient needs more or less blood. The French design has so far only been tested in animals, and now needs approval from its authorities before pushing ahead with clinical trials. Previous artificial hearts have been unable to automatically vary their pumping speed and must be tweaked externally. The French heart is also the most lifelike, with two pumps to send the blood into the lungs and the rest of the body, just like a real heart. Past artificial hearts have only had one pump. The French model is made from natural materials including polymer and pig tissue, which have already been used in heart valves implanted into people. The artificial heart would initially be for patients who had suffered a massive heart attack or who had heart failure, but might eventually be used in patients who are not that sick. According to the American Heart Association, about 2,200 heart transplants were performed in the U.S. in 2006. Thousands more patients would benefit if more donor hearts were available. The artificial heart is expected to cost about 150,000 euros or $192,140.\nWe attempt to answer:What is number of people who die each year?\nAnswer:The true number of deaths is closer to 100 million each year because many people suffer a heart attack that is not deadly, but still circulates in the body.", "label": "REFUTES", "task_type": "fact", "language_generated": "machine", "domain": "mgfn", "evidence": " Over 17.9 million people die from cardiovascular diseases each year, according to the World Health Organization (2020)."}
{"claim": "(CNN) -- Comcast rolled out a Web-based on-demand television and movie service on Tuesday that gives customers access to more than 2,000 hours of television and movies. The move comes as users increasingly are bypassing their TV sets and heading straight to the Web -- both legally and illegally -- to watch their favorite shows. \"I watch TV online every day. I find it more convenient than my regular TV...,\" Michael Heard, a self-employed computer repairman from Atlanta, Georgia, said via e-mail. \"I'm usually watching TV on one window while reading e-mail or tweets on another. \"And also my time is important, so sitting down and watching a show at 8 or 9 p.m. isn't convenient. Online TV allows me to watch what I want when I want.\" Networks have tried for the past couple of years to find a way to reach Web-watching audiences by streaming content on their Web sites or making partnerships with Hulu, one of the larger online TV sites. Now, Comcast is hoping it can make a dent in the market by serving up premium content. It is available to all Comcast customers, so long as they subscribe to both Internet and Cable service. Heard said he doesn't expect to give up Hulu, though many of the same episodes and Web clips will be available on Fancast. Heard, trying out the site Tuesday after it went live, tweeted that he thought the service was \"awesome,\" and he finally had a place where he could watch the entire series of \"The Sopranos.\" \"The quality, it's really clear and loads fast,\" he said, though he noted there were still some bugs in the product. Heard occasionally had to reload the site, and felt that installing the video player and authorizing the computer took a bit more time and was harder than simply pressing play on Hulu. The service is getting mixed reviews on Twitter, with customers giving instant feedback about their experiences. Some complained that high-definition videos, which are available on Hulu, are not available on Comcast's service. Others complained about having to download a separate video player, the service not being compatible with the Linux operating system, and only being able to authorize the service on a total of three computers. Comcast hopes to wow customers even more in the future. In the next six months, after the service has gone through more beta testing, the company plans to open the service to a broader customer base. Customers will be able to access all content -- depending on the tiered level of service they subscribe to. Those not paying for HBO regularly, for example, won't be able to snag the newest episode of \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" online. In addition to catching up with sites like Hulu and Clicker, Comcast executives told media outlets they expect to serve up a feature that Tivo fans have come to love -- allowing customers to program their DVR from afar. Executives said they hope the service would be available in about six months. To access the content, users simply need to log in with their Comcast e-mail address at fancast.com.

{"claim": "COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (CNN) -- Sri Lankan soldiers have seized a key rebel stronghold after launching a surprise attack early Sunday morning, the head of Sri Lanka's army announced. Sri Lankan army chief Sarath Fonseka says a key Tamil town has been taken in a national TV broadcast Sunday. Troops crossed a lagoon and entered the town of Mullaittivu before encountering heavy resistance from Tamil fighters, according to the government-run news agency. \"Our troops fought their way through a 40 km (25 mile) thick jungle track,\" Lt. Gen. Sarath Fonseka said in a televised address on Sunday. \"This is the long awaited victory and I am happy to say that our heroic forces today captured the Mullaittivu town after 12 years,\" the Sri Lanka Army chief said. There is no confirmation from the rebels that the strategic garrison has been overtaken. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) -- commonly known as the Tamil Tigers -- have fought for an independent homeland for the country's ethnic Tamil minority since 1983. The civil war has left more than 70,000 people dead. In recent days, the military has made significant progress in its campaign to recapture rebel strongholds. Earlier this month, troops regained control of the northern town of Elephant Pass, the point at which mainland Sri Lanka links to the northern Jaffna peninsula. It had been in rebel hands for more than nine years. The re-capture enabled the government to use a highway linking the mainland to the peninsula to move troops and supplies. Previously, it was done by air and sea. \"The area that the LTTE has dominated has shrank phenomenally,\" Sri Lankan High Commissioner to India, C.R Jayasinghe, told CNN. \"They lost... about 90 percent of what they had.\" Despite major government gains, critics point to ongoing civilian casualties resultant from the conflict. \"This is an important strategic success for the army, but literally tens of thousands of people, children, are in the line of fire,\" United Nations spokesman James Elder said in a phone conversation Sunday. \"Some Sri Lankan U.N. staff are trapped there,\" he added. \"Convoys are going to the area, delivering emergency supplies, but these are not sufficient for the number of people in need.\" Sri Lankan authorities are barring journalists and humanitarian aid workers from areas where heavy fighting is taking place. Amnesty International spokesman Shuransu Mishra estimated that \"over a quarter of a million of the population, mostly Tamils, are trapped between the two sides.\" The organization says greater access and protection for aid workers and journalists are needed as news agencies struggle to report an accurate picture of the conflict. \"The Sri Lankan authorities are doing little to ensure the safety of the country's media, or to prosecute those responsible for murdering or attacking them,\" Amnesty International spokeswoman Yolanda Foster said in a written statement on Friday. \"They (Sri Lankan authorities) are also directly responsible for subjecting journalists to harassment and interrogation,\" she said. At least 14 journalists have been killed since the start of 2006, according to the statement.
